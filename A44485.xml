            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT hath ever been an Objection (grounded upon ignorance,) which hath been made by the meaner ſort of the people to traduce the Common Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to bring the Profeſſors thereof into contempt, to give out Speeches, and caſt it in the teeth (as it were) of them, That the ſaid Lawes are built but upon a ſandy foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> the conceits of a few men, and that they are not grounded upon the Lawes of God; from which all Lawes of men ought to flow, as from a cleare and pure Fountaine.</p>
                  <p>This vulgar conceit and objection
<pb facs="tcp:40544:3"/>hath been principally nouriſhed amongſt them, becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawes have been kept from their view and underſtandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part publiſhed in the French Tongue.</p>
                  <p>I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe, That ſince it is a received Maxime amongſt us, That ignorance of the Law doth excuſe no man, that it were good that the fundamentall Lawes were publiſhed in our Mother Tongue, that ſo no perſon might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſant thereof. And I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it hath been the courſe and care of moſt of the late Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Lawes, to put them forth in ſuch Language as the common people might the better know them, and practice the due obſervation of them. But that I may with the more eaſe and plainneſſe anſwer that fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Objection, remove that fond conceit of the ignorant, vindicate our Commnn Lawes from ſo foule an aſperſion, and let the Objectors ſee from whence our Lawes deduce
<pb facs="tcp:40544:3"/>their Originall (though the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authour in the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe hath in part done it) yet for the cleare manifeſtation thereof I ſhall entreat the courteous Reader to be pleaſed favourably to accept of this ſhort Breviary of the Grounds and originals of the Common Law, which I ſhall apply only as an introduction to the Work which followeth.</p>
                  <p>All Lawes are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Three-fold diviſion: 1. The Law of Nature. 2. The Law of God, of Faith, or of the Goſpell. 3. The Law of man, made upon the Dictates of Reaſon; upon all which Lawes the Common Lawes of <hi>England</hi> are built, as upon firme and ſure foundations.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, that which is called the Law of Nature, which is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, and may be called Gods Law, united unto mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <note place="margin">Gen. 1. ver. 26,27.</note> for what was that Image of God in man, conſiſting of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, holineſſe and truth; but <hi>Lex primordialis,</hi> a primordiall Law,
<pb facs="tcp:40544:4"/>exactly requiring, and abſolutely enabling the performance of duties of Piety unto God, and of equity to men both in habit and Art. <note place="margin">St. Ambroſe</note> 
                     <hi>Amiquam ſcripte fuit lex in hominum mentibut vigebat.</hi> God in the beginning wrote his Lawes in mens hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according unto the opinion of moſt learned Divines and Legiſts: <hi>Lex nature nibil aliud eſt quam parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatio legis eterne in rationali creatura;</hi> And according to others, <hi>Lex naturae eſt lamen ac dictamen illud rationis, quo inter bonum &amp; malum diſcernimus.</hi> The moſt principall Precepts of the Law of Nature) which are alſo Maximes and Grounds of the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) are 1. <hi>Deum venerari,</hi> 2. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtè vivere,</hi> 3. <hi>Patrie magiſtratibus, &amp; parentibus obedire,</hi> 4. <hi>Alteri ne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias quod tibi non vis fieri.</hi> 5. <hi>Suum cuique tribuere.</hi> 6. <hi>Tollere nocentes è medio propter ſervandam publicam ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> 7. <hi>Rerum dominia proprietates, poſſeſſiones, &amp; uſum diſtinguere;</hi> To ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, to live honeſtly, to obey Magiſtrates, &amp;c. to doe as we would

                  <p>Theſe fundamentalls of the Law of Natvre are not principally acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or obtained by Art, or Doctrine, but naturally ingrafted. Learning and inſtruction ſerve only to bring forth and encreaſe thoſe naturall Seedes; but neither Learning nor inſtruction doe principally and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally give them; they are (faith <hi>Socrates</hi>) but as skilfull Midwives, <note place="margin">Socrates.</note> whoſe office it is only to further the birth of the Childe not to beget the Childe.</p>
                  <p>The Second is the Law of God, the Law of Faith, or of the Goſpell; which may well be called <hi>Lex amoris,</hi> the Law of love. Is not this Nation Chriſtian? Hath it not profeſſed the common Faith for 1200. yeares? Doe not our Lawes all tend to the maintaining of peace, concord and
<pb facs="tcp:40544:5"/>love fruits of the Goſpell? Are not all Statutes, Acts of Parliament, Conſtitutions Cuſtomes, made and uſed for the government of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, founded upon ſuch principalls? Let the Objectors cite me any Law in uſe now amongſt us, which is not warranted by ſome expreſſe Goſpel, Text, either in the Letter, or not by neceſſary conſequence drawne from it; ſure I am that every Law, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Uſage, Priviledge, Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Act of Parliament, or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which doth exalt it ſelfe above or beyond the Law of God, the Law of Chriſt, or the Law of Nature hath ever by the worthy Sages of our Lawes been declared to be void It were to no purpoſe to inſtance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particulars, it is ſufficient to ſay; That as it appertaineth to all godly and Chriſtian men to obſerve and keepe this Law; ſo to let all men know, that we are inſtructed by the worthy Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, in the fundamentall Rules and grounds of this Law, to
<pb facs="tcp:40544:5"/>live after it, and to direct all our words and actions according to it; and by it, and therefore I ſhall not ſay more of it.</p>
                  <p>The third the Lawes of men, and the municipall Lawes of this Realm, which although they may ſeeme to ſome to have their progeny from men, (for as <hi>Solon</hi> to the <hi>Athenians, Lycurgus</hi> to the <hi>Lacedemonians, Numa Pompelius,</hi> and <hi>Actius Claudius</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were accounted the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Authors and givers of Law to thoſe ſeverall Nations; ſo <hi>Alured</hi> on <hi>Alfred, Athelſtone, Edmundus, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Canutus, Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, <hi>William</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, called <hi>Beauclark,</hi> noble and famous Princes of this Nation, part of all whoſe Lawes are yet in force, were the chiefe promulgers of many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and good Lawes yet in uſe with us in this Realme) yet if we looke into their Laws we ſhall finde, that moſt of them have their riſe from a higher power, from the Law of God, and the Law of Faith.

                        <p>That Law by Ordinance of our holy Predeceſſors is divided into two Volumes;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40544:17"/>into the Cannon Law, which conſiſteth in the amendment of Spirituall offences; Firſt, by Admonitions, Prayers, Reproofs, Excommunication; Secondly, into the written Law, which conſiſteth in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of temporall Offences, by Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Attachments, and puniſhments or penalties.</p>

And at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they made the King to ſweare; That he ſhould maintaine the Chriſtian Faith with all his power, and governe his people by Law, without having regard to the Perſon of any one; and that he ſhould be obedient to ſuffer Right as well as his other people ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>And afterward this Realme was divided in Inheritances according to the number

                        <p>THere are many who know not how to defend their Cauſes in Iudgement, and there are many who doe, and therefore Pleaders are neceſſary, ſo that that which the Plaintiffes, or Actors cannot, or know not how to do by themſelves, they may doe by their Serjeants, Atturnies, or friends.</p>
                        <p>Countors are Serjeants skilfull in the Lawes of the Realme, who ſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to declare and defend Actions in Iudgement, for thoſe who have need of them for their fees</p>
                        <p>Every Pleader of others Cauſes ought to have a regard to foure things. 1. That there be a perſon receiveable in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he be no Heretique, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Perſon, nor Criminall, nor a man of Religion nor a woman, nor within the Orders of a Subdeacon, nor a Benificed Clerke who hath cure of Soules, nor under the age of 21. yeares, nor Iudge in the ſame Cauſe, nor attainted of falſity in his place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Another thing is; That every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is chargeable by Oath that he ſhall doe no wrong not falſity contrary to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ſhall plead for his Cliant the beſt he can according to his underſtanding.</p>

                        <p n="4">4 The fourth thing is as his Sallery, concerning which four things are to be regarded; 1. The greatneſſe of the Cauſe. 2. The paines of the Serjeant. 3. His worth, as his Learning, eloquence, and giſts. 4 The uſage of the Court.</p>
                        <p>A Pleader is ſuſpendable when he is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted to have received ſees of two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in one Cauſe; and if he ſay o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Law requireth that offenders in caſe of death have not ſuch mittigation or favour that they be brought or ſummoned, or diſtreined to appeare in Judgement by taking of their Cattell if the offenders be knowne, and notorious, and the Plaintiffe purſue them to ſoone as he may. And if any one fly for ſuch offence, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Statute of Wincheſter he was to be followed with Hue and Cry, with Horne and Voyce, ſo that all thoſe of one Towne who can are to follow the Felon to the next Towne; and if any ſuch Felon be attaint and convict of the felony, let him be killed if he cannot be otherwiſe apprehended. But it is otherwiſe in felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not knowne, for it is not lawfull to kill the offender without his Anſwer, if he may be taken alive.</p>
                        <p>And if any one would complaine to have revenge, or to drive the offender to the ſalvation of his Soule; let him goe to the Coroner of the place where the offence was done, and ſet forth his complaint there as he will prove it, and the Coroner is to cauſe the ſame to be diſtinctly enrolled; and if he cauſe him to record it as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being corrupted to deſtroy his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by his plaint; ſo that he have Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the like is to be done to him if he prove not his plaint.</p>

                        <p>A Goale is nothing elſe but a common Priſon, and as a Leper, or a man who hath a diſeaſed body is not to be ſuffered to dwell or remaine amongſt men who are ſound; ſo mortall ſiune is a kind of Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which maketh the Soule abhominable unto God, and therefore ſuch mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or offenders ought to be ſeparated from the ſociety of the people. And to the end that Innocents be not infected with their offences, Goales were Ordained in every County to keepe ſuch mortall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in, there to remaine till Iudgement were given againſt them in caſe the offences were notorious.</p>

                        <p>THere are many who ſeeke not Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtanding they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the King mortally; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe the King is bound <hi>Ex officio</hi> to compell them to ſalvation, the King uſed every ſeaven yeares to goe through all Shires in his Realme, to make enquiry according as before is ſaid; further, in aide of ſuch Eyres were Coroners, Sheriffes Turnes, Viewes of Franck-pledges and other Enqueſts to enquire of thoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as is ſaid.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe ſome are wrongfully ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, King <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. Ordained, that none ſhould be arreſted nor impriſoned for ſlander of mortall offence before he were thereof endicted by the Oathes of honeſt men, before thoſe who had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to take ſuch Indictments, and then they were firſt to be ſeiſed upon by their bodies, and goods, as in Appeales, and to be kept in priſon till they cleared them of the infamy before the King or his Juſtices.</p>
                        <p>Of the Crime of Majeſty in no kind was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40544:58"/>any Indictment but of Hereſie or Romery, whereof if any were indicted and brought to Judgement, let there be an indictment for the King by ſome of his people in this manner, according to that which is found in the Roles of ancient Kings.</p>
                        <p>I ſay <hi>Sebourge</hi> there is defamed by good people of the ſinne of Hereſie, becauſe that he of evill Art, and beliefe forbidden, and by Charmes and Enchantments he tooke from <hi>Brighten</hi> by name, &amp;c. the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Alc, whereby he loſt the ſale thereof, ſo that Judgement be not given of leſſe then three perſons; or thus, <hi>Molling</hi> who is there defamed by good people, that ſuch a day he denied his Baptiſme, and cauſed himſelfe to be circumciſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Iew, or a Saracen, or offered or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to <hi>Mahomet</hi> in contempt of God, to the Damnation of his Soule; and this offence he did feloniouſly, &amp;c. and ſo in every like Caſe for the King; and if he will deny it I am ready to prove it upon him for the King, as to the King it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to doe; that is to ſay, according as an Infant within age.</p>
                        <p>Of falſifying thus; I ſay for the King, that <hi>Mimunde</hi> there is defamed, &amp;c. for that he ſuch a day, &amp;c. falſifyed the Kings Seale, or his Money, in ſuch a kind, or ſuch, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Of Treſpaſſes Indictments now ceaſe; of Burnings thus, I ſay &amp;c. that <hi>Seabright</hi> there is defamed, &amp;c. for that at ſuch a day, &amp;c. he ſet a fire ſuch a houſe or goods, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Of Murder thus, I ſay &amp;c. that ſuch a one, with ſuch a weapon ſtruck <hi>Agole</hi> in ſuch a part of his body, by which ſtroke he is killed, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The degrees of Acceſſories are to be ſhewed after the Principalls according to their right.</p>
                        <p>Of Larcine in this manner; I ſay, that <hi>Cutbert</hi> there, &amp;c. robbed ſuch a man knowne, or unknowne of his Horſe, or of other kind of goods, &amp;c. or feloniouſly ſtole, or was conſenting to the offence of ſuch Theeves knowne, or of unknowne Theeves by taking of Theef-hoot which is a recept of Larcine, which he wittingly took to ſuffer ſuch a one to paſſe, or to ſtop Suit, or wrongfully to procure his pardon.</p>

                        <p>A Perſonall offence is divived into two branches, whereof the one extendeth to Perſons, and the other to Goods.</p>
                        <p>The Veniall offence which extends to Perſons is divideable into great offences, and ſmall offences; and although the King have Counſans of all offences, yet he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth only the ordering of all groſſe offences to himſelf, and the Counſance of the leſſer he leaves to all thoſe men who have Courts within their Demeſnes; and upon this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offences hath the King eſtabliſhed the Peace, ſo as ſuch Lords &amp; Bayliffs have the ordering of the Peace for ſmal offences.</p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40544:59"/>
                        <p>The Veniall offences Perſonall are theſe, Perjury when one telleth a lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King;, and Perjury of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; The mortall offences not declared fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniouſly, as Impriſonment, Mayheim, Wounding, Battery, are to be ſhewed without Appeales, Allienation of old trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſound, Diffeſin, Reddiſſeiſin, and many others; the declarations of Perſonall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, venialls, infamatories, are to be declared at the Kings Suit in this manner:</p>
                        <p>I ſay for our Lord the King, that Y there is Perjured, and lyed againſt the King; that whereas the ſaid I was the Kings Chancellour, and was ſworne that he ſhould not ſell not deny right, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediall Writ to any Plaintiffe, the ſaid Y ſuch a day, &amp;c. and ſold to ſuch a one a Writ of Attaint, or other remediall Writ, and would not grant it him for leſſe then halfe a marke, &amp;c. Or thus, whereas he was one of his Iudges aſſigned, and was ſworne to doe Iuſtice, &amp;c. he in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ſuch a Court gave Iudgement, or awarded againſt ſuch a Party, or relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a Party, or uſurped ſuch Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the King; or made himſelfe Iudge, Coroner, or Sheriffe, Bayliffe, or other Miniſter of the Kings without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; or thus, whereas he was Channcellor of the Exchequer, &amp;c. he forbad to give an Acquittance of ſo much as ſuch a one had paid of the Kings debt under the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Seale, or delayed to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance from ſuch a day till ſuch a day,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40544:60"/>and would not give an Acquittance unleſſe he bought it for ſo much; or thus, for that he holdeth Plea againſt the Kings forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in prejudice of the King and his Crowne, and the rather ſeeing it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to any Eccleſiaſticall Judge to hold ſecular Pleas, but only of Teſtamentary and of Matrimony; or thus, he diſturbed the giving of Judgement, or ſurceaſed ſo to do juſtice by negligence, or by his conſent.</p>
                        <p>In this manner are the Preſentments to be made at the Kings Suit, of Perſonall wrongs of all his Miniſters great and ſmall; and alſo againſt all others not his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of all wrongs done to the King by thoſe who have ſworne fealty to him.</p>

                        <p>And there is a difference betwixt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are to cauſe death, and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Actions, for as much as to mortall Actions the Suit is to be brought firſt againſt the Principalls, and afterwards againſt the Acceſſories; and in Veniall

                        <p>Of Pledges, note that thoſe are Pledges for purſuing who the Plaints affirme, and thoſe are Pledges who reprieve any other thing beſides the body of a man, for they are not properly Pledges, but Maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſors, becauſe they ſuppoſe that thoſe plevifables are delivered to them by Bayle for the body.</p>
                        <p>The ordinary Declaration of Veniall Plaints begins in this forme; I ſhew unto you who am here; that <hi>E.</hi> who is there wrongfully delayed his Action, by a falſe eſſoigne which he caſt ſuch a day, in ſuch a place, &amp;c. to the great damage of the Plaintiffe.</p>
                        <p>And of Treſpaſſes done againſt the Kings Peace it is eaſie to ſhew, and of Treſpaſſes done againſt Lords or Bayliffes, and in hatted of falſe Plaints, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Ordained, that audience were forbidden

                        <p>It is called <hi>Novell,</hi> to put a difference from thoſe which are ancient, for ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings uſed to goe over the Shires to enquire, heare, and determine offences, and to redreſſe the wrongs there, and that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40544:63"/>which was not brought in ſuch Eyres of perſonall Treſpaſſes before remained to the Judgement of God alone; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by reaſon of the multitude of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that Kings could not doe all by themſelves, therefore they ſent their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries who now are called Juſtices in Eyre, who have not power to decree and determine a perſonall offence, but for a thing brought and not determined in the laſt Eyre; Then for as much as the Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or the perſonall Action was brought before the Eyre, the Action or Diſſeiſin was ancient; but if the Diſſeiſin be done ſince the laſt Eyre, then it is a Novell Diſſeiſin.</p>
                        <p>Diſſeiſin is a perſonall Treſpaſſe, of a wrongfull putting one out of poſſeſſion, it is ſaid wrongfull to put a difference from rightfull, which is no offence; as if I take from my Wife, or my Villain, or from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is my Ward that which is my owne; or if you take from me that which is mine, I take it from you againe, I doe not offend, for I am warranted ſo to doe by the Law of Nature, ſeeing this uſage is common to Men, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Fowles, and other earthly Creature;, but I cannot doe ſo afterward; for if I take from you forcibly any thing whereof you have had the peaceable poſſeſſion, I doe diſſeiſe you, and I doe wrong to the King, when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſe him of his right, or uſe force where I ought to uſe Judgement. On the other ſide, that which is taken from me by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40544:63"/>rightfull Judgement of any Judge Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or Arbitraty, is not taken wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from me.</p>
                        <p>Wrong is here taken as well for deforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſturbance, as for ejection.</p>
                        <p>Deforcement, as if another entereth into anothers Tenement, when the rightfull ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is at the Market, or elſe where, and at his returne cannot enter therein, but is kept out, and hindred ſo to doe.</p>
                        <p>Diſturbance is, as if one diſturbe me wrongfully to uſe my ſeiſin which I have peaceably had, and the ſame may be done three waies.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 As when one driveth away a diſtreſſe, ſo that I cannot diſtreyne in the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyable to my diſtreſſe, whereof I have had ſeiſin before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Another is where one doth Repleive his diſtreſſe by the Sheriffe, or the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wrongfully.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 As if one diſtreyne me ſo outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I cannot manure, Plow, or the my Land duely; in which Caſe it maketh one an outragious diſtreyner to diſſeiſe, or for to eject the Tenant; as if any one eject me out of my Tenement, whereof I have had peaceable poſſeſſion by diſcent of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or other lawfull title to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
                        <p>Note that all right is in two kinds, either in right of poſſeſſion, or in right of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore the right of property is not ſo determinable by this Aſſize, as is the knowne poſſeſſion, or as that which

                        <p>Into this offence fall all thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any waſt, exile, or deſtruction in Lands, as that which is not juſtifiable by Law, as thoſe who aſſigne over Lands to others, where in the Feoffments to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their Anceſtors there is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but of Heires only, and that may be two waies, <hi>viz.</hi> to Heires generall, or to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Heires, named as in Fee tayle, or not

                        <p>A reaſonable diſtreſſe is to the value of the thing in demand without any other fault, for no outragious diſtreſſe is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lawfull.</p>

                           <p>Of all things not forbidden by Law. The Law forbiddeth that a man doe not make a Contract of the right of another, although he offend not; the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Contracts of Uſury, Diſſeiſin, hurting of the body, diſ-h heriting, and of other offences or vices.</p>
                           <p>Contracts are forbidden which are to the damage of the Party gayning, by vice, by forbidding mixture of offence.</p>

                           <p>In the third Caſe, as if I make any Contract with thoſe with whom it is not lawfull, Nevertheleſſe the Contract of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is not forbidden betwixt Infants, although it be uſed to be, but in caſe of Diſparagements; for diſparagement is an offence which is greatly forbidden.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. II. SECT. 28.</hi> Of Villinage and Neiftie.</head>
                        <p>AN Action of Villinage, or Neiftie is a mixt Action, grounded upon a Perſonall Treſpaſſe done to another, when a man porſecutes a Free-man to enſlave his blood.</p>
                        <p>This Action is a Mixt Action in favour of Liberty, for very ſeidome will any one depart from his Lords Mannour, if he claime not himſelfe to be a Free-man.</p>
                        <p>This Action hath Introduction, by Summons, and Attachments of the Lands.</p>
                        <p>A Waive is nothing elſe buta Villaineſſe, and notwithſtanding that according to the Law of Nature all Creatures ought to be free, nevertheleſſe by Conſtitution, and by the Deeds of men, (are) they and other Creatures enſlaved, as it is of Beaſts in Parkes, Fiſhes in Ponds, and Birds in Cages.</p>
                        <p>The Villinage of man is a ſubjection of ſuch great Antiquity, that by the memory of man no free Stocke can be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which ſlavery according to ſome is the Curſe which <hi>Noah</hi> gave to <hi>Caanan</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Cham</hi> his Son, and to his iſſue, and according to others of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who became ſlaves at the battaile which was betwixt <hi>David</hi> and the children of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40544:71"/>
                           <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the one party, and <hi>Goliah</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine on the other part.</p>
                        <p>And as other Creatures are kept in inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo are villains kept to guard the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of their Lords, and from thence are ſaid Regardants; and ſo men are villains by the Law of God, by the Law of man, and by the Cannon Law.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> come the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Chriſtians, and from thoſe from <hi>Cham,</hi> the Villains which the Chriſtians may give away, or ſell as they doe other Chattels, but not deviſe by Will, becauſe they are Aſtriers, who are annexed to the Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenement, and of them there are many others.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe are Villaines who are begot of Villaines and Neifts in ſervitude, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borne in Mattimony or out of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; thoſe alſo are Villaines who are begotten of Villaines, and borne of Free-women in Matrimony, and thoſe are Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines who are begotten of a Free-man and a Neife, and borne out of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                        <p>The other manner of Villaines are thoſe who are adjudged Villaines by a Writ of <hi>Nat vo babendo,</hi> and their iſſue after them.</p>
                        <p>Villains become free many waies; ſome by Baptiſme, as thoſe <hi>Saracens</hi> who are taken by Chriſtians, or bought and brought to Chriſtianity by grace.</p>
                        <p>Some became Free by the Pope, as it is of thoſe villains who by Biſhops are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Orders of Deacon, and above;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40544:71"/>but norwithſtanding the ſame a man ſhall not loſe his right thereby who will ſue for them.</p>
                        <p>On the other part villains become Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men if their Lords grant, or give unto them any free eſtate of Inheritance to diſcend to their Heires, or if the Lord take their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for their land, or if the Lord eject them out of their Fees and give them ſuſtinance; or if he put them in a common Priſon if it be not for crime.</p>
                        <p>A woman after ſhe is put in poſſeſſion by her Lord, is never againe to be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged as a Neife, notwithſtanding ſhe be ſold.</p>
                        <p>And if the Lord ſuffer his Villaine to Anſwer in Judgement without him in a perſonall Action, or to be a Jurour amongſt Free-men, as a Free-man knowingly, and without the Lords claime; the Villaine hath this Plea to the Villinage if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not of his owne accord.</p>
                        <p>Alſo a Villaine becomes free through the Lords default in a Writ of <hi>Native Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendo,</hi> as by his Non-ſuit in the Writ.</p>
                        <p>Alſo by proofe of a free Stocke, or to have been borne of free Parents.</p>
                        <p>Alſo by the Lords grant in Court, and alſo by preſcription; alſo for default of proofe, and alſo by the Lords negligence, as by the remaining of the Villaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a City, or upon the Kings Demeſnes for a whole yeare; Or if wittingly he ſuffer his Villaine to be a Suiter in another Court, or to be ſworne in Aſſize, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40544:72"/>amongſt Free-men; if a Villaine depart from his Lord claiming free eſtate, ſo that he cannot ſeiſe him within the Mannour within the yeare, or out of his Fee, nor after his Writ of <hi>Nativo Habend.</hi> brought, it belongeth to the Lord that he bring againe that Action which is <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Countiel,</hi> and pleadable in the County by Summons, and Diſtreſſes of his Lands; for the Law requireth that he doe right, and uſe not force</p>
                        <p>The Parties being brought to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the County Court, and the Action being declared in the Defendant by way of exception may plead that he is Franck, and becauſe that a free eſtate is of a higher nature then Villinage; therefore becauſe the Sheriffe hath not power to try ſo high a Plea by the Writ of <hi>Nativo Hebendo,</hi> thoſe Writs and ſuch Pleas are ſuſpendable till the comming of the Juſtices in Eyre into thoſe parts; but if the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to the contrary, thoſe Pleas are not adjournable but from one County Court to another</p>
                        <p>Note that all Villaines are not ſlaves, for ſlaves are ſaid Regardant, as before; they can purchaſe nothing but to the Lords uſe, they know not in the Evening what ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And note, that thoſe who are free, and quit of all ſervitude, become ſervile by Contracts made berwixt the Lords and the Tenants.</p>
                        <p>And there are many manners of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Fees, as of Gift, of Rent, of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Leaſe, which all may make for a time, or for ever, and quitment without Obligation, and charge of ſervice, and with charge.</p>
                        <p>And theſe Contracts (as all other) are made by Writings. Charters, and Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſolemne Witneſſes, according to the example of Contracts of Marriages,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40544:73"/>which ought to be a patterne to all other Contracts; according to which Example were the firſt Contracts made by the firſt Conquerour, when the Earles were enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offed of the Earldomes, Barons of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies, Knights of Knights Fees, Serjeants of Serjanties, Villaines of Villinages, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes and Merchants of Boroughs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome received their Lands without Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, or ſervice, or in Frankalmoigne; ſome to hold by Homage, and by Service for defence of the Realme, and ſome by Villaine Cuſtomes, as to Plough the Lords Lands, to Reape, cut, and carry his Corne, or Hay, or ſuch manner of ſervice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving of any wages, whereof many Fines were leavied of ſuch ſervices, which make mention of the doing of theſe baſe ſervices, as well as of other more gentile ſervices; and although it be ſo, that the people have no Charters, Deeds, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Lands, nevertheleſſe if they were ejected, or put out of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions wrongfully, by bringing an Aſſize of Novell Diſſeiſin, they might be reſtored to their eſtates as before, becauſe they could averre that they knew the certainty of their ſervices, and workes by the yeare, as thoſe whoſe Anceſtours before them were Aſteries for a long time, in caſe Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were not their Lords.</p>
                        <p>And thereupon Sr. <hi>Edward</hi> in his time, <note place="margin">Doom-day Booke, Vt credo.</note>cauſed enquity to be made of all ſuch who held, &amp; did to him ſuch ſervices as plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lands, &amp;c. beſides their lawfull Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes.</p>

                        <p>Every one may Anſwer without a Tutor who is not forbidden by the Law.</p>
                        <p>The Law forbiddeth Married women to Anſwer without their Husbands, but then we are to put a difference in the Caſes; for if ſhe be within the age of one and twenty yeares, ſhe is not admitted to Plead in any Caſe without her Husband, but in Caſe where her diſ-inheriting, or that which doth amount to as much doth appeare by the malice, or negligence of her Husband; &amp; if ſhe be of full age, then ſhe ſhall ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awer alone in caſes of death and Felony; and ſo it is of men within the order of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of Villaines, and of all thoſe who are in Cuſtody, and are not delivered.</p>

And there are two kindes of juniſdiction, Ordinary, and Aſſigned. Every one hath ordinary juriſdiction, if of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence take it not away from him; for every one may judge his owne according to the righte rules of Law, But this juriſdiction is now reſtrained by the power of Kings, in as much as none hath power to held Plea of Trespaſſe or of Debt which paſſeth 40 s. but the King. Nor anie hath power of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins of Fees without a Writ. Nevertheleſſe, it is lawfull for every one to f. ouſt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall offender, for committing of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by good witneſſes, by warrant of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juriſdiction, whether the offenders bee Clerks or Lay people, of age, or within age, and all others of what condition ſo ever they be; and in thoſe coſes are thoſe offences cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notorious offences.</p>

And all manner of Grants, Rents, and Contracts; and all manner of Actions which they had againſt any manner of perſons, were void, not only from the time of judgement, but from the time of the Felony; for which ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, and ſuch perſons could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againe reſort to anſwer the Felony, if the Proceſſe of Outlawry were not faulty, if not by the great mercy and favour of the King; Weomen were not pleviſibles, and put in dozens as men but were waves.</p>

                        <p>Andin the ſecond place yee are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh; for one mannet of ignorance is, as of a thing known had nor been known, and this kinde of ignorance doth excuſe; the other is of a thing not knowne which ought to have been knowne, although he was not bound to know it, and this excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; alſo the third kinde is, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of not knowing that which a man is bound to know, and this excuſeth not; And note, that ignorance in its ſelfe is no offence, but this neglect of knowing is an offence. The Iudge doth not offend ſo much that he doth not make the Law, but he offendeth in fooliſh undertaking upon him to Iudge fooliſhly or falſly. The fourth kinde of ignorance is, that a man Iudgeth of a thing otherwiſe then right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and if ſuch ignorance come of the fact it excuſeth, and of the Law then it excuſeth nor. Or thus, there is one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ignorance which one may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſuch excuſeth not; and there is another kinde of ignorance which one cannot vanquiſh, and ſuch excuſeth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it come by nature, or by too much paſſion, or ſickneſſe, as of rage.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40544:115"/>ſole ſtroke, all of them generally are adjudged Men-ſlayers for the apparant evidence of the fact; for none but God can Iudge the intentions of thoſe that gave the ſtroke that it was to kill, nor who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled therein to hinder that any huſt were done, with a good intent; ſome who command what may be for hurt, or may be for good; ſome which held the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and others who ſtroke.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V. SECT. 2.</hi> The defects of the great Charter.</head>
                        <p>SEeing how the Law of this Realm ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon forty points of the Great Charter of Liberties is damnably diſ-uſed by the Governours of the Law, and by Statutes afterwards made contrary to ſome of the points, to ſhew the defects or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of the points aforeſaid; and the errours of ſome Statutes I have put in memory this Chapter of the defect; and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40544:142"/>reprehenſions of Statutes, and firſt of the defects of the points of the Great Charter.</p>
                        <p>To the point, That the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhall have all her Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inviolable; for firſt it were neceſſary to ordaine a Corporall puniſhment, and namely to the Lay Judges, the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and others who Judge Clerkes for mortall Crimes to Corporall puniſhments, infamatories, &amp; doe detain their goods after their purgation, and to thoſe Secular Judges who take upon them Cognizance in cauſes of Matrimony, and Teſtaments, or other ſpeciall things.</p>
                        <p>The other point is, That every Free-man of the Realme inherite the Liberties of the Charter, and whereof every one is diſſeiſed as of his Free-hold, which is not adjudged according to the points following, there lyeth no recovery of damages by the Aſſize of <hi>Novel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third point ſeemeth to be defective, for as the releife of an Earldome entire was to decreaſe in him who held leſſe, ſo it ſeemeth that that certainety was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as much if an Earle held more, ſo as he who held two Earldoms, and who held an Earldome and a Barony, ſhall pay as an Eardome and as a Barony; and ſo of other Fees if they be not expreſſed in the Charter, that the Fyne of one hundred pound be not an Eirldome for no point oncreaſed, and ſo of other certainties.</p>
                        <p>The fourth point is defective (for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40544:142"/>it be that ſuch a point be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Law, to binde the Lord of Fees to warranties by taking of ſuch Homages, whether they tooke them of the right Heires or not) becauſe it is not expreſſed whoſhould be Guardian of the Fees in time of vacancy, and have the iſſues in the mean time in caſe where the right Heires fly from their Lords, or cannot or will not doe their homage.</p>
                        <p>In the points of Wards it is defective, for as much as no difference is expreſſed between the heires Males, and the heires Females, for a woman hath her age when ſhe is fully of fourteen yeares, and the ſeaven yeares beſides were not ordained firſt but for the Males, who before the age of one and twenty yeares were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beare Armes for the defence of the Realme.</p>
                        <p>And note that every Guardian is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to three things: 1 That he maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the infant ſufficiently. 2 That he maintaine his rights and inheritance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waſte, 3. That he anſwer and give ſatisfaction of the Treſpaſſes done by the infants.</p>
                        <p>The defect of the point of Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appeareth amorgſt the Statutes of <hi>Merton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the default of Franckbenches and Widowes in the ſame manner, in which point it is ſufficiently expreſſed that no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is dowable if ſhe have not been ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly eſpouſed at the doore of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40544:143"/>and there endowed.</p>
                        <p>In the point which requireth that the City of <hi>London</hi> have its ancient Liberties, and her free Cuſtomes, it is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this manner; That the Citizens have their Liberties whereof they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited by lawfull Title of the gifts and confirmations of Kings, which they have not forfeiſed by any abuſe, and that they may have their Liberties and Cuſtomes which are ſufferable by Law, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law. And where it is ſaid (of <hi>London</hi>) that the interpretation be as well of the Cinque Ports, and of other places.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth tortious Diſtreſſes for Fees is Covenable in it ſelfe, but the ſame ſhal not grieve any man of the Realme who hath Tenements, that it is no Treſpaſſe in him, or by his Miniſters, as appeareth in the Chapter of <hi>Nativo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas follow not our Court, is to be interpreted in this manner; That the people ſhall not travail to Sue in the Kings Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the Country as they uſed to doe. But this point willeth, that the Plaintiffes have Commiſſions to Sheriffes, to Lords of Mannours, and to Juſtices aſſigned, ſo that right be done to the parties in certaine places, where the Parties and Jurours may be the leſſe travailed.</p>
                        <p>Although it be that the Chapter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that <hi>Petit</hi> Aſſizes be taken in their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40544:143"/>Counties, being made for the eaſe of Jurors, yet it is diſuſed, in as much as the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make the Jurours to come from the furtheſt marches of the Counties, whereas it were better that the Juſtices Rod from Hundred to Hundred, then ſo to travaile the people.</p>
                        <p>The point of Amercements is miſuſed by Iuſtices, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Stewards, <note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> and others who amerce the people in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in this manner, putting ſuch a one to ſo much for a Contempt or other Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe withont a perſonall Treſpaſſe, and without the afferment of the people ſworn to it, and without ſpecifying the manner and the quality of the Contempt.</p>
                        <p>Againe, where the Afferrours ought to be choſen with the aſſent of thoſe who are amerced, and in a common place, the Lords make the Afferrours to come to their houſes to aſſer the Amercements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their pleaſures.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be defended is diſ-uſed, <note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> for many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are now appropriate and gotten, and ſo put in defence, which uſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Fiſh in in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Chapter which forbiddeth that Sheriffes, Conſtables, Coroners, nor Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes ſhall hold Pleas of the Crowne ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not needfull, for appeales of felony are not here to be brought before Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, and the exigents and Iudgements pronounced, and therefore this point had need to have had more words to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40544:144"/>have expreſſed the meaning of it.</p>
                        <p>For the end of the Chapter of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good; of the dead, it appeareth that the Action accrueth to the Widowes, and to the Children to demand their reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of the goods of their Father ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                        <p>That which is forbidden to Conſtables to take is forbidden to all men, <note place="margin">Cap. 19, 20.</note> in as much as there is no difference betwixt taking from another againſt his will and liberty, whether it be Horſes, Victuals, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, Carriages, or other manner of goods.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter for holding the Lands of Felons for a yeare and a day is out of nſe; for whereas the King ought not to have the waſt by Law, or but the yeare in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>cers take both.</p>
                        <p>The defence of the Precipe is not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in that they doe it without Writs of poſſeſſion of Farmes every day, that the Lords loſe the Cognizance of their Fees, and the advantages of their Courts.</p>
                        <p>The point which commands that one Meaſure be throughout the whole Realm, and one Weight is diſ-uſed by Merchants, and Burgeſſes, uſing for the pound the old Weight of twenty ſhillings of right Aſſize, and alſo of Ells and other meaſures.</p>
                        <p>The defence which is made of the Writ <hi>De odio &amp; atia,</hi> that the King be not Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, nor take any thing for granted, the VVrit ought to extend to all remedial VVrits, and the ſame VVrit ought not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40544:144"/>extend onely to the felonies of Murder, but it ought to extend to all felonies, and not onely in Appeales but in Endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth that no Bayliffe put a Free-man to his Oath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suit, is to be underſtood in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, That no Juſtice, no Miniſter of the King, nor other Steward nor Bayliffe have power to make a Free-man make Oath without the Kings Command, nor receive any plaint without Witneſſes preſent who teſtifie the plaint to be true.</p>
                        <p>The point where the King granteth that he will not diſſeiſe, nor impriſon, nor deſtroy, but by lawfull Iudgement, which overthrows the Statute of Merchants and other Statutes is to be interpreted thus, that none be arreſted, if not by warrant groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a perſonal Action, for if the Action be veniall, no Impriſonment is juſtifiable, if not for default of Maine-pernors. And ſo it appeareth that none is impriſonable for Debt. And if any Statute be made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this point, either for the Kings Debt, or for the Debt of any other, it is not to be kept. That (none be Outlawed) is to be meant, if not for mortall felony, from which one is ſaved by the Oath of Neighbours, <hi>ex officio,</hi> as it is the uſe in Eyres; and therefore that deſtroyeth the Statute of Outlawry of a man for arrerages of Accompt, and all other the like Statutes; and that which is ſaid, that none be (exiled nor deſtroyed) is to be interpreted
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40544:145"/>in this manner, that every one have an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to appeale all Perſons, all Suitors, all Aſſeſſors who deſtroy men againſt the right courſe, and againſt the rules of Law.</p>
                        <p>On the other part, where the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth that none be diſſeiſed of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, of his Liberties, or of his free Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes is thus to be underſtood, that one ſhall recover by Aſſize of <hi>Novel diſſeiſin</hi> every manner of Free-hold, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Poſſeſſion reall of Lands, or of Franchiſes whereout one is caſt, if it be not by lawfull Iudgement; and theſe words (if it be not by lawfull Iudgement) referre to all the words of this Statute.</p>
                        <p>The point which the King grants to the people, that he will ſell no Right, or hurt nor delay Iuſtice, is miſuſed by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, who ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ls the remediall Writs, and calls them Writs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The point concerning leave for the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Merchants, Alliens, is ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that it be not prejudiciall to the Townes, not to the Merchants of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that they be ſworne to the King if they ſtay longer then forty daies.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth that none Allien his Land in prejudice of the Lord of the Fee, is to be interpreted in this manner, that no Tenant allien the Fee of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40544:145"/>his Lord without his conſent, or to hold in chiefe of the Lord without encreaſe of new ſervice.</p>
                        <p>The point of the cuſtody of Abbies, and of religious places when they fall is thus to be underſtood, that every Lord have the keeping of his Fee during the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>The point that none ſhall be taken or impriſoned upon the appeale of any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for the death of any other then of her Husband, is to be meant of ſuch a woman which the Husband laſt held for his wife, if in caſe there be many wives alive.</p>
                        <p>The points concerning Sheriffes Turnes and Viewes of Franck-pledges are diſuſed three waies; the firſt that Sheriffes, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes, and Stewards take extortion of Fines, in that they make the people to fine for what they are not occaſioned which they call for Beaupleader. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that they amerce the people for Preſentments upon perſonall Actions. The third is, that they charge the Iurours with Articles touching Treſpaſſe done by Neighbour to Neighbour, or of Tenant, or of other Lord then to the King.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth religious perſons to purchaſe Lands, overthroweth the Statute afterward made at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> of the ſame, for as much as the Action of the chiefe Lord is limited in ſo ſhort time, to haſten the Kings Action in prejudice of the Lords of the Fee.</p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:40544:146"/>
                        <p>The laſt point is of ſuch vertue and of ſuch meaning as that the King hath the Cogniſance of Treſpaſſes done in ſuch manner, as that the Fee-Tenants have their Courts, and the Cogniſance of Treſpaſſes done within their Mannours, and alſo as well of reall Actions, and Perſonalls, as of mixt.</p>

                        <p>SOme points are reproveable amongſt the Statutes made at Merton after the Great Charter made, and namely the point of Rediſſeiſins. Since the Law doth not attaint any Treſpaſſor by enqueſt of Office, and becauſe Pleas may perhaps availe the Tenants, and ſhould be by Law allowable, Aſſizes lye to the example of Novel Diſſeiſin; and where it is ſaid, that Rediſſeiſors be arreſted and kept in Priſon, and afterwards that they be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is but an abuſe of the Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that every one who is attainted of a perſonall Treſpaſſe be puniſhed by a Corporall puniſhment, if he cannot ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome it by money; and that which is ſaid of this Statute is to be underſtood of all Statutes made after the Great Charter,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40544:146"/>made in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 1. for it is not Juſtice that he ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for one fault with Corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as impriſonment or other, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a pecuniary paine, or by ranſome; for ranſome is nothing but a buying out the Corporall puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>The point of Improvements of Waſts is reproveable as being too generall, for it ought to diſtinguiſh of Commons; for in ſome places the Commonors are infeoffed in ſuch manner that the whole Common is onely in the Tenants, ſo that the Lords have nothing but the ſoile, and in ſuch caſe that Statute is prejudiciall to the Commoners, and repugnant to the Great. Charter, which willeth that none be caſt out of his Free-hold, not the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances without lawfull judgement.</p>
                        <p>The point of Rape of Marriages is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, in as much that it hath an Exception of Perſons of Laymen, and of Clerkes, for there is no more Law that a Clerke ſhould offend without puniſhment then a Lay man.</p>
                        <p>Other points are repugnable; If the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doe damage to his Lord, or <hi>è contra,</hi> for they are not puniſhable according to the Statute, but they are bound by their Homage and Fealty betwixt them, as it is before ſaid amongſt the judgements of defaults.</p>
                        <p>The points of making Atturnies in Suits at Hundreds is to be underſtood in this manner; That although a Suitor by this

                        <p>The Chapter which commandeth t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e Great Charter to be kept in all points is defective for want of addition of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it ſeemes croſſe to make conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions not holden.</p>
                        <p>The Chapters remedialls of Lords of Fees is reproveable in the mittigation of puniſhment: For all thoſe who doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Law are puniſhable by a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhment, and not by a ſimple Amercement.</p>
                        <p>The point of Proclamation of Wards is reproveable, as that which is founded
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40544:147"/>upon Errour, as it appeareth in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of defaults.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter of Rediſſeiſors is reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for that no ſpeciall command ought to exceed Common Right, not any paine of impriſonment is judgeable but for a wrongfull impriſonment.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter of daies in dower is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, ſince the Law haſteneth right more in the Kings Court then clſewhere.</p>

                        <p>The Chapter which forbiddeth that none make his Tenants Jurours is reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe that no puniſhment is therein ordained, and becauſe it hath no Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for there are many Caſes where the people ought to be Jurours though they come not by the Kings Command, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Juſtices of Forreſts, before Coroners, and before Eſcheators, and as in Courts of Sheriffes and Viewes of Frauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledges, and as Afferrours, and at Goale deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter which commandeth the arreſting of thoſe who are bound to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt is reproveable, ſince the Action is mixt, and requireth Summons, and not perſonall Arreſts.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter of waſters of Farmes is reproveable, for waſte is a perſonall Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,

                        <p>MAny Chapters are reproveable of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> For the points touching religious Perſons are matter to gaine monies, and a purchaſe upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of covetouſneſſe, more then for their advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter of Clerkes found guilty of felony is reproveable, for for want of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhment theſe Clerkes are not to be delivered to Ordinaries, but at the pleaſure of the King, and of his Juſtices.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter of Wreck is reproveable, in as much as the finder is forjudged by the Statute to have part thereof, whereas he ought to have part of the profit, and ſo it is reproveable, as to the awarding of the puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Of the points of Amercements is before ſpoken in the Great Charter.</p>
                        <p>The point of takings of diſtreſſe is much reproveable, <note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> as before is ſaid.</p>
                        <p>The Chapter concerning purſuing of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons to maintaine the Peace is reproveable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40544:148"/>in the puniſhment, for he is conſenting to a Felon who doth not apprehend him when he may.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame manner is it of the Chapter of Coroners, contained in the Articles following.</p>
                        <p>The point of Election of Coroners was not needfull to have been ordained, <note place="margin">Cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth more the Electors to have wiſe and loyall Coroners then to the King, and it had better have been enacted that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners doe preſent the points of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the Seales of the Jurours, then Sheriffes ſhould make counter parts of the Rolls.</p>
                        <p>The point of Enqueſt of <hi>Odio &amp; aria</hi> is reproveable, <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> for <hi>London</hi> and other places in Liberties where there are no Knights.</p>
                        <p>The point of putting people found guilty of felony, who will not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Country to pennance, it is out of uſe that one kill them, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regard to the conditions of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and therein it is reproveable, ſince one may perhaps helpe and acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe otherwaies then by his Country, and in as much as none is to be put to Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance before he be attainted of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for which he ought to be pained.</p>
                        <p>The Ordinances of puniſhments of long impriſonment are to be reprehended as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid.</p>
                        <p>The point of the order of Outlawry of the principalls before the Acceſſories is no Statute, but a revocation of errour.</p>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40544:149"/>
                        <p>The point of Repleviſalls is reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, according as it is ſaid of Actions; the puniſhment of long impriſonment containe Errour as is ſaid before.</p>
                        <p>The puniſhment of Heites males Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as againſt the King, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Lords, betwixt 14. yeares and 21. yeares is reproveable, for then the King ſhould have amends for that, for which he hath not any perſonall Suit for the amends.</p>
                        <p>The point of Heires females containeth Errour, as appeareth in the reprehenſion of the point of Marriages in the Great Charter.</p>
                        <p>The point of tortious Diſtreſſes ought to contain the puniſhment for the robbery.</p>
                        <p>The puniſhment of Miniſters, Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors by colour of their Office is reprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſmalneſſe of it, as appeareth amongſt the Judgements.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth Sheriffes that they take no rewards is reproveable in as much as the King taketh of them, and they take nothing of the King.</p>
                        <p>The point of Fines of Clerkes, and the officers of Juſtices in Eyre is reproveable, for the common grievance of the people without taking of profit.</p>
                        <p>The points of impriſonment are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable for the reaſons aforeſaid, and the point of Tolls for the puniſhment of impriſonment, and becauſe Tolls are not eſtabliſhed certaine.</p>
                        <p>The point which willeth that thoſe who
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40544:149"/>diſ-uſe Marriages ſhould loſe them, was not needfull to have been made, for the Law is, that he ſhall loſe his Franchiſe who uſeth it not.</p>
                        <p>The point of the Receivers of the Kings monies and not rendring the ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, for the ſmallneſſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to that which appeareth before.</p>
                        <p>The Errours of taking of Carriages and other goods appeareth ſufficiently by the reaſons before.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth Judgement to be given by Strangers in Counties is reproveable, for no Iudgement given by another then an ordinary Judge aſſigned is to hold.</p>
                        <p>The point which maketh mention of Robbery, or Diſſeiſins is reproveable, for all thoſe are to be ſeiſed upon who the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours indict of Robbery, according to the example of Theeves and other Felons.</p>
                        <p>The point of Attaint is reproveable, for it ſhould not extend to one caſe, but it ought to comprchend all Oathes taken by twelve men if one of the Parties complaine thereof.</p>
                        <p>The point of limitations of Actions is reproveable, for the reaſons in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given upon the ſame matter.</p>
                        <p>The point which forbiddeth falſities and abuſes uſed in Courts before this time to falſe Judges, who uſed not the Law by ſufferance of falſities.</p>
                        <p>The point of Champions is reproveable,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40544:150"/>for no Champion is to be receiveable as a witneſſe.</p>
                        <p>The point of not allowing Eſſoignes in Aſſizes after appearance, is reproveable by the Aſſize of Novel diſſeiſin, where no Eſſoigne is allowable for the Tenants no more before appearance then after, not in no other perſonall Action.</p>
                        <p>The other points of Eſſoignes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, for no falſe cauſe of Eſſoigne ought to advantage any man.</p>
                        <p>The point of delaies in Pleas of Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reproveable in many points, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingas appearethin the chapter of defaults.</p>
                        <p>The point to plead upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge falleth in prejudice of Sheriffes, and of Lords of Fees, and of Liberties; and although the two points of Diſſeiſins, that is to ſay, that every one may avoid the damages in the point of perſonall treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe done to his Anceſters in as much as his Action lyeth, of what age ſoever the Parties be, yet is the firſt reproveable, for as much as the Plaintiffes have no recovery for the damages done to their Anceſtors, not any Action, but to have reſtitution of the poſſeſſion.</p>
                        <p>The other point is reproveable for the ſmallneſſe of the puniſhment, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to common right this puniſhment ſhould have time, that he ſhould never doe Homage betwixt them for the Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, when he beginneth to diſ-inherite his Tenant contrary to the right of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:40544:150"/>
                        <p>The Prayer of the King is reprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe he ought to aske nothing contrary to Law, but it is the prayer of the Juſtices who deſire alwaies to have much to doe.</p>
                        <p>The point that if he who is vouched to warranty ought not to warrant, although he be bounden by the deed of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor whoſe Heire he is, in caſe he alledge that nothing deſcended to him from that Anceſtor by whoſe deed he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ouched is reproveable, for according to the old Law, Lands remained liable to the Debt of thoſe who acknowledged it, to whoſe hands ſoever the Lands afterwards came.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame manner it uſed to be in all other Contracts, where the Contracts were adjudged or granted; and although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſcended to the Heire for that he loſt not the Tenements for want of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, and if he who bound himſelfe to warranty would not warrant the Land, not vouch over, it appeareth thereby that the Anceſtor was Tenant by a naughty title, and that he was poſſeſſor thereof by an ill way; and if the Heire had nothing whereby to diſcharge him, the Tenements bound to warranty ſhould be recovered. And if the Heire had nothing whereby to diſcharge, not no Land is found bound to the warranty, if the Purchaſor loſt his purchaſe it was at his owne perill, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his owne folly, the better at any other time to looke to his aſſurance.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THat which is ſaid of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. which faileth in many caſes is now to be underſtood, for againſt all Treſpaſſes is the Law made although it be diſ-uſed, or controuled by thoſe who know not the Law.</p>
                        <p>And the three firſt Chapters are not Statutes, but are the revocations of the Errours of negligent Judges, for the Law permits not that a man make a better eſtate to another then himſelfe hath, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that every lawfull Contract be made according to the wills of the ſpeakers; and that which is in the Statute, that if a Fine be leavied in deceit of right, that the ſame be <hi>null</hi> is reproveable; but it might have been better ſaid, That for that Fine, that no man be barred of his right, for the Fine leavied cannot be rightly ſaid <hi>null,</hi> but it holds in force, and barreth at the leaſt the Donor of his Action.</p>
                        <p>The point if Diſtreſſes doth not repeale any Errour, but affirme them, as before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the ſecond beoke.</p>
                        <p>And that which is ſaid in the ſecond Statute, that Suitors in Counties have no
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40544:151"/>Record, is but abuſion, ſince every lawfull reſtimony is a Record, and every falſe teſtimony is a lye; and as lawfull may other people teſtifie as the Juſtices aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Is not the ſame Writ abuſed, to grant to Counties Records in Outlawries, Pledges, Maine-priſes, Battailes, Grand Aſſizes and other Caſes, and not other points, and to deny that the Sheriffes or Lord of the Fee, or other to whom the King ſendeth his Writ, hath not as well Record of Proceſſe before him, as thoſe whom they call Iuſtices, is but Errour?</p>
                        <p>And as to the cauſes of Writs of paines is ſuffered great Errour, that that which is not warranted in the Acceſſory, that he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the principall, ſince the Law permits that none be aided by a lye or a vicious Writ.</p>
                        <p>Of the other ſide, becauſe there is more realty in the Statute then perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as more Attachments are awarded in perſonall Actions then in mixt and realls.</p>
                        <p>The point of Meaſnes is reproveable, as to the Proclamation, and as to the <hi>non</hi>-acquittance of thoſe who hold by leſſe ſervice then the Meaſnes, for be it that <hi>B.</hi> hold one hundred pound Land of <hi>D.</hi> by the ſervice of twenty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and the ſame <hi>B.</hi> give the moyety thereof in Frankalmoigne, or Frank marriage, or to hold by the ſervice of a Roſe to <hi>C.</hi> if it happen that the ſame B. forfeited what he hath, by this Statute no remedy is ordained for <hi>C.</hi> who was purchaſor from <hi>B.</hi>
                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:40544:152"/>and therefore the old courſe is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which is ſaid before in Iudgements.</p>
                        <p>The remediall Statute of the right of the Wife loſt by the default of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is reproveable, for the old Law was, that a woman after the death of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould repleeve her Inheritance or purchaſe ſo loſt, ſummoning the Tenants, for a Cape is not, but a diſtreſſe and eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſeaſin ſaving every right; and it is lawfull for one of the Tenants in common to defend his right where he is damnified by the negligence or the <hi>non</hi> ability of his Partner. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may a Woman according to Law in the right of her Husband; neither doth the Law give to Widowes Action to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Dower in the caſes named in the Statute, but in all caſes the Law enables her to be received by Lawfull reverſing of the Iudgement.</p>
                        <p>And that which is contained that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants may vouch to warranty, is but abuſe; how holdeth voucher place where a Writ lyeth not; yet is it underſtood with a ſaving, that no juriſdiction of a Iudge aſſigned extend to other Perſons then thoſe who are named in the Writ, and that none ſhall vouch more then in the ſame Writ are named, by Writ of <hi>Replegiare,</hi> and therefore are warranties attainable and determinable by Writs.</p>
                        <p>The Statute following, which Ordaineth new Writs remedialls after defaults, is prejudiciall to Lords of Fees, who loſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40544:152"/>the advantages of their Courts, becauſe that Writs of Right are forbidden in ſuch caſes where they wont to be uſed.</p>
                        <p>Preſentments to Churches ought not to be but in the names of thoſe to whom the meere right of the Advowſon doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, according as is ſaid before in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; and it is errour and abuſion of Law to endow women of Advowſons, or to Leaſe them to Farme, or for the terme of anothers life, or in Frank-marriage, or in Mortgage, or in Fee-tayle, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in Fee-ſimple.</p>
                        <p>And thoſe who receive Clerkes preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Churches, in prejudice of thoſe to whom the meere right in Fee doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, are bound to make reſtitution of the damages, and thoſe who have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Jurours by whom they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of the right of the perſonage; and ſo it appeareth that the puniſhment lyeth more againſt the Biſhops then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors.</p>
                        <p>And that which enacteth long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for a puniſhment, is but abuſe; ſince none is impriſonable if not for a wrongfull impriſonment.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of Warranties is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Errour uſed againſt Law.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of Admeaſurement is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable in many points, as to the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, ſince admeaſurement and ſurcharge are to be by Jurours.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of Meaſnes is reproveable in many points, as it appeareth in the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40544:153"/>Chapter of Diſtreſſes, Contracts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, and the ſame appeareth in the end of the Statute where the Plaintiffes know not a ſet fine.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of ſuſpenſion of Writs in Eyres is reproveable, as repugnant to the great Charter, which ſaith, we will ſell no Right, nor detaine it, and wherefore are Writs rebuttable from heating but for the multitude of Writs which are, and for the ſmall number of Juſtices the right of many periſh.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of obligees in Accompt is reproveable in many points, one as to the exception to the Perſons, for the Maſters is ordained recovery, and to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants not, when Auditors are aſſigned without the conſent of the ſervants.</p>
                        <p>The other, that the Auditors are not tyed to allow any thing but at their pleaſure without puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Another, that the recovery is ordained by detinue of the ſervants, and not againſt the Surety, not the goods.</p>
                        <p>Another, that the Lords are not to be Atteſted according as of the ſervants.</p>
                        <p>Another, that the wickedneſſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors remaineth unpuniſhed.</p>
                        <p>Another of Outlawry, for none is to be impriſoned if not for a tortious impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of Appeales is reproveable in two points, one in the ſpecialty of the Corporall puniſhment, and of the Plurality puniſhments, ſince the redemption by a

                        <p>The Statutes of Waſte are founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Errour ſince waſte is a perſonall Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and requireth other manner of Proceſſes, as appeareth in the Chapter of defaults; and to defend a perſonall Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe by Writ is but a vaine labour.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of not allowing a falſe cauſe in the Eſſoigne <hi>De malo lecti</hi> is defective, for in no Eſſoigne for no Party is any falſe cauſe, or any falſity to be permitted, not ought to be profitable to any.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of Debt and Damages reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered is defective, for not onely ſhould ſuch remedy be in the Kings Courts, but it ought to comprehend in all other Lay Courts.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of thoſe who are dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wills is defective, for it ought to comprehend Felons, and Fugitives as well as true men; and the King, and all others into whoſe hands their goods come as well as Ordinaties, for none can forfeit the right of another.</p>
                        <p>The Statute for allowing one manner of Exception in the like Actions was not needfull to have been made if not for the negligence of Juſtices, for every affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is encounterable with his negative at the perill of the party.</p>
                        <p>The Statute of detinue of ſervice is a novelty daugerous to Lords of Fees, as

                        <p>The Chapter of making new Writs had not need to have been made, if the firſt Ordinances of Writs were obſerved.</p>
                        <p>The Statute to have remedy by Aſſize, of <hi>Novel diſſeiſm</hi> is reproveable, for as much as it comprehendeth not Lands charged with Villain Cuſtomes, not Lands holden for terme of yeares.</p>

                        <p>And that which appeareth in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of falſe Appeales is more errour then right in the enacting the award of amends to Defendants, whereas it is not to the Plaintiffes.</p>
                        <p>And as to the Writ to the uſe of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes in Diſſeiſin, it is no Statute, but it is a thing at pleaſure, and a wrong.</p>

                        <p>The Statute of Rape is reproveable, for none can ordaine by Statute that a veniall puniſhment be turned into a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, without the conſent of the Pope, or the Emperour.</p>
                        <p>The Statute that the King hath the Suit
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40544:155"/>in Rape, or in Ellopment of women Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried is reproveable, for none is bounden to Anſwer to the Kings Suit if not by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, or by Indictment.</p>
                        <p>And that which is contained in it, That Women ſhould loſe their Dower for the ſinne of Adultery, ought alſo to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all Adulterours, who claime to hold the inheritances of their Wives by the courteſie of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that there be no exception of perſons.</p>
                        <p>The impriſonment of the Alloppors of Nunnes and their ranſome is no Law, but is an errour in a double manner, as before is ſaid in many places.</p>
                        <p>The impriſonment for two yeares or more, ordained for a Corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Raviſhers of Marriages is but er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for no Corporall puniſhment ought to be ordained but for common profit, as before appeareth of open Penances.</p>

                        <p>The Statute of Iurours is reproveable, for the Law wills that the Plaintiffes have the aide of the Courts to cauſe the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to appeare, whereby they may the more lawfully helpe themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction of perſons.</p>
                        <p>And that, that juriſdiction is granted to Juſtices aſſigned to <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> Plaints, without a ſpeciall Commiſſion is but abuſe.</p>
                        <p>The Statute which awardeth that Writ of Judgement be made without warrant of originall Writ is nothing elſe then a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to falſifie the Kings Seale.</p>
                        <p>The puniſhment of Sheriffes ill anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is reproveable, as to the puniſhment; for diſ-inheritors of the King offend of the crime of Majeſly, and are by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence puniſhable by death, which ought not to be in ſuch caſes.</p>
                        <p>And as to iſſues the Statute is reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for no iſſues are awardable but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defaults in Actions mixt, and not to the Kings uſe, but for the profits of the Plaintiffes.</p>

                     <p>ANd note, there is another Court cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Common Pleas, which Court hath juriſdiction to hold Common Pleas, as well perſonall Pleas as reall, or any other <hi>Precipe quod reddant,</hi> of Lands or Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c, of Debt, Detinue, Accompt, and other perſonall Actions; and they have power to hold Plea of any of thoſe Actions, which may be brought in the Kings Bench as Actions of Maintenance, Conſpiracy, Forgery of falſe Deeds, and Actions upon the caſe, and treſpaſſe againſt the Peace, of ſuch Actions wherein the King ought to have a Fine, and alſo of Attaints; but they have not power to hold Pleas of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales of Murder, Rape, Felony, Mayhem, nor to enquire of them, nor of Riots.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſaid, That one may Sue the Peace againſt another before the Iuſtices of the Common Pleas, and if the Party be in the Hall, or in the Place, or within their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40544:162"/>View, they may ſend the Warden of the Fleet to bring the party before the Iuſtices to finde Sureties, or elſe commit him to the Fleet; and the reaſon why they may ſo doe is, that good order, and the Peace be kept about the Court; but the Iuſtices have not power to award Proceſſe to the Sheriffe to Arreſt the party to appeare in the Court where the Common Plea is; but it is otherwiſe of the Kings Bench, as it is ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſaid, That the Iuſtices of the Common Pleas have juriſdiction in ſome things which touch the Crown, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and hold Plea of ſome felony, and alſo of miſpriſion, and of deceit done within the Court, and within the Record thereof.</p>
                     <p>And if one imbeſell a Pannell after the Enqueſt paſſed, and Iudgement given in the Common Pleas, by which the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reverſable by Errour for want of that Pannell; the Iuſtices of the Common Pleas have power to enquire of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſelment of the Pannell by 12. of the Officers and Atturnies of the ſame Court, and they ſhall be ſworn before the Iuſtices to enquire of that default; and if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the embeſſelors they ſhall be Arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereupon, and ſhall be compelled to anſwer thereunto as other Felons, &amp;c. and if they be attainted they ſhall forfeit their goods and chattels, <hi>tamen quaere, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>And if one be condemned in Debt, or treſpaſſe in the Common Pleas, and he be in the Hall, the Iuſtices at the prayer of

                     <p>And ſee another difference betwixt the Judges of the one Bench and of the other, for it is ſaid, That if the Judges of the Kings Bench doe award Proceſſe in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon, a Writ of right, or execution of Land recovered in value, the Sheriffe ought to execute the Writs although they have not any juriſdiction therein. But if the Judges of the Common Pleas will grant Proceſſe of Treaſon, &amp;c. out of their place, the Sheriffe ought not to execute the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, for that authority is onely of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>ANd note, that the Court of Chancery is a Court of a high nature, out of which Court iſſue all originall Writs, and there a man ſhall traverſe Offices and ſuch things; and in that Court women who are widowes to the King ſhall be ſworne that they ſhall not marry without the Kings Licence, before the time that they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed; and it is ſaid, That of errour there upon a Patent, or a Traverſe, the ſame cannot be reverſed elſe where but in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>Quaere &amp;c.</hi> And in that Court a man ſhall have remedy for that which he hath no remedy at the Common Law; and it is called by the common people, <hi>The Court of Conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore ſee of matters in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how the party ſhall have remedy.</p>
                     <p>If a man hath Feoffes to his uſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Will, and thereby willeth that his Feoffes ſhould make an eſtate to <hi>I.</hi> for terme of his life, the remainder to <hi>C.</hi> in Fee; if the ſaid <hi>I.</hi> will not take the eſtate what remedy is for him in the remainder, in conſcience, and how he ſhall helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chancery, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A man ſhall have remedy in Chancery for Covenants made without writings, if the party have ſufficient Witneſſes to prove the Covenants, and yet he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy at the Common Law, &amp;c. And for Evidences, when a man knowes not the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40544:164"/>certainty of them, nor in what they are contained; it is uſually to be releeved in Chancery, for he is without remedy by the Common Law, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If a man infeoffeth another of certaine Lands to his uſe, and the Feoffee ſelleth the Land to another, if he giveth notice to the Vendee at the time of the ſale of the intent of the firſt Feoffment, he is bounden to performe the will of the firſt Feoffer, as it ſeemeth in the Chancery.</p>
                     <p>A man was bounden unto another by Obligation in a certaine ſumme of money, and the Oblgee brought an Action upon the ſame Deed in another County then where the Obligation was made, and had Iudgement to recover; and the Obligor in Chancery ſued to be releeved, and it was ſurmiſed that by that forraigne Suit he was outed of diverſe Pleas which he might have had, if the Action had been brought in the County where the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, and it was conceived a good matter to releeve him in equity.</p>
                     <p>In the Court of Chancery a man ſhall not be prejudiced by miſpleading, or for want of forme, but according to the truth of the Cauſe judgement ought to be given according to equity, and not <hi>Ex rigore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> And note that there are two juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ordinary, and Abſolute; Ordinary is as poſitive Law, and Abſolute is <hi>Omnibus modis quibus veritas ſciri poterit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a man be bounden by Obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two men unto the uſe of one of them,

                     <p>And if a man hath recovered againſt another debt or damages, and he hath paid the ſame without any Acquittance, or without having a releaſe, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the party taketh execution againſt him upon the ſame Iudgement, he ſhall have no remedy by the Common Law; and it was then ſaid by the Chancellor that he ſhall not have any remedy in equity in this caſe; and if the ſame ſhould be remedied in equity, then every Record ſhould be examined before him, and thereby the Common Law overthrowne.</p>
                     <p>And if I doe infeoffee one upon truſt, and the Feoffee doth infeoffee another of the ſame Land upon truſt, <hi>Quaere</hi> if I ſhall have a Subpoena againſt the ſecond feoffee, but where he is infeoffed <hi>bona fide,</hi> there the firſt Feoffer is without remedy againſt the ſecond Feoffee, as it ſeemeth.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid, That the Chancellor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> whereſoever he ſhall be in <hi>England,</hi> hath power to command a man to priſon, and he ſhall not be bayled; <hi>Quaere</hi> whether

                     <p>The meanes and the remedy how a man may come to his due, and to that which is wrongfully kept from him, and that is by plea, and this word is generall, and hath divers effects implyed therein, and may be divided into divers branches, <hi>viz.</hi> Into pleas of the Crowne, as appeales of Death, Robbery, Rape, Felony, and divers other things, &amp;c. and into Actions reall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Lands, Tenements, Rents, and other hereditaments are demanded, as Writs of right, Formed on, &amp;c. Or Actions poſſeſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as Writs of Entre, Aſſize of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dameſter, Coſinage and the like, &amp;c. And it may alſo be divided into Actions perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as Debt, Treſpaſſe, Detinue, &amp;c. and into Actions mixt, as into Aſſizes, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40544:168"/>of waſt which are as well in the realty as in the perſonalty. A perſonall plea may be divided into two parts, one into a meere perſonall plea, as an Action of debt, detinue, where none hath intereſt but the parties themſelves; the Plaintiffe and the Defendant. And the other part is mixt in the Crowne, the Plaintiffe and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant have not the ſole intereſt in thoſe Actions, but the King hath an intereſt in them alſo to have a fine; as in an Action of Treſpaſſe, <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> and that is an Action mixt with the pleas of the Crown, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And note that in matters of the Crown, for ſuch for which a man ſhall ſuffer death, ſome may be principalls and ſome acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as Murder, Felony, Rape, and the like; but in High Treaſon I conceive all are principalls, &amp; in petit treaſon there may be principall and acceſſory as well as in felony</p>
                     <p>In a Premunire all are principalls, and in cutting out of Tongues, and putting out of Eyes there may be an acceſſory as well as a principall, as is ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In Robbery all are principalls who are preſent at the time of the Robbery done, otherwiſe it is in Mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et; for if one be preſent and doth nothing he is an acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not a principall, &amp;c. In Mayhem ſome ſay, that all are principalls, as well he who is comforting and abetting as he who giveth the Mayhen; as it is in Treſpaſſe, <hi>tamen quaere,</hi> for I conceive the Law to be contrary, &amp;c. And it was ſaid, That if a man be preſent at the death of a man, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40544:168"/>moveth another to kill the man, that he is a principall, notwithſtanding that he giveth him not any ſtroke, and notwithſtanding that the Count in every Appeale is, That every principall did mortally ſtrike and wound him, &amp;c. but thoſe are words of forme, and the blow of him who ſtruck is the ſtroke of him who commanded him when he was preſent.</p>
                     <p>And it is to know that for ſuch things for which a man deſerveth death, there are two waies to bring him to anſwer the ſame; one by Appeale, which is at the Suit of the party the other is by way of Indictment, which is at the Kings Suit, &amp;c. And for a Mayhem the party ſhall have an Appeale of Mayhem, wherein he ſhall recover damages, and no death ſhall follow, &amp;c. and ſee the Appeale following, and firſt of the Appeale of the death of a man, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>And it ſeemes the Appeale of Murder ought be be brought within the yeare and a day after the death of him who is murdered; and in an Appeale the party hath two iſſues, to put himſelfe upon the Jury to try if he be guilty or not, or to wage Battaile, and to make the Battaile with the Appellant; and if he doe gage Battaile he ought to deſigne the battaile in his proper perſon, and by no Champion. But it is otherwiſe in a Writ of right, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And there are divers cauſes to ouſte the Defendant in the appeale of Battaile, for it is ſaid, That if an Infant within age bringeth an Appeale, and the Defendant ſheweth that he is within age, &amp;c. the Juſtices have been of opinion that he ſhall be put to anſwer the Appeale of the Appellant being within age, and the Defendant hath loſt the advantage to wage the Battaile, becauſe it was his owne Act. And I conceive that if a Woman bringeth an Appeale of the death of her Husband againſt another, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſhall loſe the advantage of Battaile;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40544:169"/>for he cannot Combate or deraigne the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile with a Woman, &amp;c. And if a party be indicted of the Felony or Murder, &amp;c. he ſhall not wage battaile.</p>
                     <p>And ſee that in an Appeale of the death of a man againſt two, the one as Principall, and the other as Acceſſory, and they waged Battaile, and the Plaintiffe demurred upon the plea, and it was ſaid, That the Acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould not be put to anſwer till the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall was attainted or acquitted; yet it is ſaid, That the Acceſſory ſhould anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but the iſſue ſhould not be tryed till the Principall were attainted or acquitted; and if the Principall be acquitted the other iſſue ſhould not be tryed.</p>
                     <p>And I conceive that in every caſe of Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where a man is indicted as Principall, and afterward hath his pardon, or forjureth the Realme, that in thoſe caſes and the like the Acceſſory ſhall not be arraigned, becauſe that when the Principalls life is pardoned in what manner ſoever it be, the Felony is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and by conſequence acquitted, and by the ſame reaſon the acceſſory is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But <hi>Quaere</hi> what the Law is if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall have his Clergy.</p>
                     <p>And ſee that where there are three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the middlemoſt killeth his eldeſt Brother, the youngeſt Brother ſhall have the Appeale, and yet he is not his Heire. The ſame Law where the eldeſt Brother killeth his Father, the youngeſt ſhall have the Appeale if there be but two Brothers.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40544:170"/>And where the Wife killeth her Husband, the Heire ſhall have the Appeale as it is ſaid. <hi>Quaere</hi> what the Law is in the caſes before, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And the Proceſſe in an Appeale of death is one <hi>Capias,</hi> and one Exigent, &amp;c. but in an appeale of Robbery, an appeale of Rape and Mayhem, the Proceſſe is two <hi>Capias,</hi> and one Exigent, &amp;c. And note that a man can never have an appeale of Robbery, Rape, or Mayhem by diſcent, for the ſame ſhall never diſcend; but it is otherwiſe of Murder.</p>
                     <p>And alſo note, that the appeale ſhall not abate, if in the Declaration be the yeare, day, and other time when the Felony was done, and it ſhall not abate for want of Freſh-ſuit, if it be not within the yeare and the day, and that is by the Statute of Glouceſter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In an Appeale if the Defendant plead that the Plaintiffe is a Baſtard, and he is certified to be <hi>mulier,</hi> yet the Defendant ſhall be received to plead not guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the beginning when he alleadged Baſtardy, he might have pleaded over to the Felony, becauſe he demanded another tryall, for the one is tryable by the Record, and the other by Enqueſt. But of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is tryable by Enqueſt if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Felony, all the ſame ſhall be tryed by one Tryall, and by one Enqueſt. In an Aſſize, if the Tonant alledge Baſterdy in the Plaintiffe, and the Biſhop doth certifie
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40544:170"/>muliarity, yet the Aſſize ſhall be taken to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the ſeiſin and diſſeiſin; <hi>quaere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>quaere</hi> if a man in an appeale plead a plea which is tryable in another County, if he ſhall plead over to the Felony, becauſe he demandeth two Tryalls.</p>

                     <p>But there are certaine things which ſhall put the ſame from that advantage, that he ſhall not wage Battaile, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant be indicted of the ſame felony, &amp;c. and if the Plaintiffe be may hemed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, or by another as I conceive; or if the Defendant be taken in the manner, or if the Plaintiffe be within age, or above
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40544:171"/>the age of forty yeares; or if the Plaintiffe be a woman or the like.</p>
                     <p>And note that if the appeale of Murder, Robbery, or Rape be brought in the Kings Bench, and iſſue be taken before the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Aſſize, if the Plaintiffe be non-ſuit they have not power to arraigne the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; but if the appeale be brought before them, and afterwards the Plaintiffe is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, it is otherwiſe as it is ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And there is another difference when a man is arraigned at the Kings Suit, and when at the Suit of the party; for if he be arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Kings Suit, he ſhall be put to anſwer the Felony, whether he be of that name or of another name; and it ſhall be no plea for him to ſay, That he is not of that Sir-name, nor knowne by ſuch a name, but by another name; for if a man killeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and is indicted thereof, he ſhall anſwer to the Felony, and ſhall not be admitted to plead miſnoſiner; but if it be at the Suit of the party it is otherwiſe, as if a man bring an appeale againſt another, there he ſhall be admitted to have the plea, and that is the difference.</p>
                     <p>Note that if a man bringeth an appeale of the death of a man who hath lawfull cauſe to have the appeale, and after Declaration he is Non-ſuit, the Defendant ſhall be arraigned a new at the Kings Suit; but if the Heire of the dead ſueth the appeale, his Wife being alive, and after Declaration the Heire is Non-ſuit; the Defendant ſhall not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40544:172"/>be arraigned a new at the Kings Suit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that none could Sue the appeale but the Wife, and ſo the Declaration was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>t warrant. And <hi>quaere</hi> how that matter may appeare to the Court.</p>
                     <p>And if one be acquitted in Appeale, or indictment where in there is no errour in the Originall; he ſhall be arraigned <hi>De novo</hi> at the Kings Suit, although that errour be in the <hi>Capias</hi> or Exigent. But if errour be in the Originall, and he is acquitted, he ſhall be arraigned <hi>De novo</hi> at the Suit of the King, becauſe that his Arraignment was never warranted but without warrant; for when the King is aſſertained of a Felon, and of the day and yeare, if the Felon be not lawfully acquitted of the ſame Felony he ſhall be arraigned at the Kings Suits. But if he be once lawfully acquitted of the Felony, he ſhall never put his life in hazard againe for the ſame Felony, if it be not for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which caſe it is ſaid, That if a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer be acquitted within the yeare at the Kings Suit, he may be afterwards in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale arraigned within the yeare at the Suit of the party, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And if an appeale of Murder be brought before the Sheriffe and Coroner in the County, it is ſaid, That it may be removed into the Kings Bench by a Writ, which ſhall be directed to he Coroner, and not to the Sheriffe, becauſe that the Coroner hath the Record; yet I thinke the Law is otherwiſe.</p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:40544:172"/>
                     <p>And if one be indicted for Murder, and afterwards an appeale is brought againſt him, and after Declaration the Plaintiffe is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, the Appellee ſhall be arraigned at the Kings Suit upon the Declaration, and not upon indictment, as it is holden in 4. <hi>E.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Note that it was ſaid by ſome Juſtices in times paſt, That in every caſe where the Defendant pleadeth a matter, whereby he proveth that the action doth not lye for the Plaintiffe as Baſtardy, or never accoupled in loyall Matrimony, &amp;c. there he need not to anſwer to the Felony; but if he pleadeth a releaſe in Bar, then he ought to plead to the Felony, becauſe it is not denyed by him that the Action once lay for the Plaintiffe, for when he pleadeth to the Felony then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that the Plaintiffe is ſuch a perſon who can maintaine the action; yet it was ſaid to the contrary, That he ſhall not plead to the Felony <hi>infauorem vite,</hi> where otherwiſe if the plea were found againſt him he ſhould be attainted, and the Felony not enquired of, and that ſeemeth to be both reaſon and Law, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And note, that when a man is found guilty for Murder, or Felony, &amp;c. for which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth death, he may pray his Booke to ſave him if he be a Clerke, and ſhall have it if he can read. But if that Bigamy at another time convicted be alledged againſt him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then he ſhall not have his Clergy.</p>
                     <p>And it was ſaid, That if the Ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth a Clerke generally, or ſpecially, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40544:173"/>the Judge may compell him to accept the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. But the old Law was, That if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary had refuſed him ſpecially, as to ſay, <hi>Non habet veſtem Clericalem, non habet conſuram;</hi> yet the Judge might compell him to accept of him. But if the Ordinary doe refuſe him generally, the Judge cannot compell him to accept of him, becauſe there may be ſome cauſe wherefore the Ordinary by the Law of Holy Church ought not to receive him. But that opinion as it was ſaid, was altered in the time of <hi>William Huſſey,</hi> and his reaſon was, That if this Judge be his Judge where the Ordinary refuſeth him ſpecially, it is as great reaſon that he ſhall be his Judge where he refuſeth him generally.</p>
                     <p>And ſee, that thoſe who are ſo attainted of Murder, or of other Felonies, and for ſuch things as they ſhall ſuffer death, they ſhall forfeit their Lands and Tenements, and their goods and chattels for ever, and the King ſhall have the Lands for a yeare and a day, and then the Lords of whom the Lands are holden ſhall have them. But he who is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Treaſon, the King ſhall have all his Lands, as well thoſe which are holden of other Lords as thoſe which are holden of himſelfe, &amp;c. And if a man hath Land in the right of his Wife, and is attainted of Felony, the Land ſhall be forfeited for the terme of his life; and it was ſaid, That if before the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, he and his wife were diſſeiſed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he were attainted and reſtored to the Kings peace; yet they could not have an Aſſize, <hi>Tamen quaere.</hi>

                     <p>And it was ſaid, That the Coroner hath not power to take any Enqueſt of the death of a man if not upon the view of the body, &amp; if he doe it in other manner, all that he doth is void.</p>
                     <p>And it hath been uſed in times paſt that the Coroners might record the breaking of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the Priſoners which are in them, and if the Priſoners were in for felony, they were put to execution without further anſwer; but <hi>quaere</hi> if any ſuch Law be now in uſe.</p>
                     <p>And a Coroner might take an appeale of an Approver, of felony done in any County of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40544:176"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> and in the ſame manter he might make abjuration, if he aſſeſted the felony to be done in another County then in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where the Coroner dwelt. And the reaſon was, becauſe by that confeſſion they ſhall be attainted. But he cannot ſo doe in an appeale of Robbery, if the felony be not done within the ſame County.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo divers Indictments, as of Robbery, Burglary, and other felonies which are mentioned in ſundry books, and the courſe of them is well known, becauſethey are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in daily uſe and experience.</p>
                     <p>If a man be indicted that he feloniouſly cut down Trees, &amp;c. in ſuch a place, and carried them away, the party ſhall not be arraigned upon ſuch indictment, becauſe it cannot be ſaid to be felony.</p>
                     <p>A man was indicted for that he traiterouſly, &amp;c. had made 100. s. of Alchamy to the likeneſſe of the Kings money, and it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the indictment was ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not put certaine what money he made, groats or pence.</p>
                     <p>A man was indicted, That whereas another man was indicted of felony who was put into the Stocks, &amp;c. that he entred into the houſe without breaking of the ſame, and ſet him out of the Stocks, and ſet him at liberty, and it was ſaid, That it remained in the pleaſure of the King, whether he ſhould have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall impriſonment, or other pecuniary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment according to the Kings Ordinance, but he ſhall not be hanged, &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:40544:176"/>
                     <p>And ſee that it was the uſe in times paſt, that the party ſhould not be reſtored to his goods upon an Indictment of Robbery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it were found that he made freſh-ſuit, if he were not appealed, yet that Law is altered and changed, and the party ſhall be alſo veſtored to his goods where the felon is arraigned upon an Indictment as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Appeale, if the party giveth evidence againſt the felon at the time of his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he ſhall not be put to circuit of Action to ſue his appeale, and it ſeemeth to be good Law.</p>
                     <p>Note, that the Writs are the principall and firſt thing in our Law, whereby a man ſhall recover that which is wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him, and they are the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Suit; and therefore looke when a man beginneth his Suit that the Writ be good, elſe all which followeth will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth; which Writs are ordained by Law according as the matter is.</p>
                     <p>And there ſee firſt the Writ of Right and the nature of it, becauſe it is a Writ of a higher nature then any other Writ can be; and the chiefe things and Articles of that Writ are, the deforcement, the quantity of the Tenements in what Towne the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, and that the demandant hath a lawfull eſtate in fee by his owne Purchaſe, or of the ſeiſin of his Anceſtor, or his owne ſeiſin, the taking of the Explees and the ſeiſin thereof, in the time of what King, and in the time of peace, and the tender of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40544:177"/>Demy marke a good diſcent, and in wha manner he hath right, and the averment.</p>
                     <p>And note that the Explees ought to be of the Demeſne or of the Services, and in a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe quod reddat</hi> of the manner of Explees in Services, &amp;c. and of the Demeſnes in Sheep, and Corne, in Paſture in feeding of Cattle, of Wood, in ſelling of the Wood, Gardens, in ſelling the Apples, or Graſſe, of Villain, is in baſe ſervice to his profit, and in ſeiſin of thoſe of his blood; and for a Chaplaine, or finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of poore men, the Explees are alledged in Maſſes, and Prayers, &amp;c. and of a Gorge in taking of the Fiſh; of a Mill, in taking of Tole: And generally, a man ſhall alledge Explees according to the matter in demand, and the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>And the triall in this Writ of Right may be two waies; the one by the Grand Aſſize, and the other by Battaile; but if the right be to be determined by the Battaile, it ſhall be done by Champions, and not by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies themſelves, as it is ſaid; and the reaſon is, that if any of the parties be killed, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land cannot be given againſt a dead perſon. <hi>Quaere</hi> if that be the reaſon or not.</p>
                     <p>And it was ſaid, That a man cannot have a Writ of Right of a Rent, but onely of a Rent-ſervice, for that other Rents are againſt common right, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And ſee that a Writ of Right doth differ from other Writs in pleading, for in a Writ of Right the Tenant ought to conclude upon
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40544:177"/>the right: To conclude, ſo that he hath more right to have the Lands, &amp;c. then the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and not to conclude Judgement of Action, as the concluſion is in other Writs, yet the ſame holdeth not in every caſe; for if the Tenant in a Writ of Right plead a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe collaterall, &amp;c. without warranty, there the Tenant ſhall conclude Judgement if Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not otherwiſe as it ſeemeth; for the demandant hath more right to the Land then the Tenant hath, but by reaſon of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty the demandant ſhall be barred of his Action.</p>
                     <p>And note, that in a Writ of Right upon the Triall no attaint lyeth, and yet in a Writ of right of Dower an attaint lyeth, which is, a Writ of Right; but the reaſon is, becauſe the Triall thereof ſhall not be by the Grand Aſſize, nor by Battaile, but by a Common Jury, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And note, that there are divers Writs of Right; a Writ of Right which is triable by Battaile, or by Grand Aſſize, as a Writ of right of Land, or a Writ of Cuſtomes and Services, a <hi>Quod permittat</hi> in the <hi>debet</hi> Writ of right of Advowſon, &amp;c. and the like. And there are other Writs of the poſſeſſion mixt with the right, as a Writ of Eſcheat, Ceſſavit, rationable part, &amp;c. and the like, but in thoſe no Battaile nor Grand Aſſize lyeth.</p>
                     <p>In a Writ of Cuſtomes and Services, the effect thereof is the wrongfull deforcement in not doing of the Services which ought to be done to the demandant out of the Land, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40544:178"/>the Land ought to be ſhewed, and how he holdeth by ſuch Services, and ſhew ſeiſin in him or his Anceſtors of Fee and Right, and alledge the taking of Explees, and the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The Articles and things which are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the Writs, appeare in the Writs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in the booke of <hi>Novel Tales,</hi> and in other bookes, and therefore they need not to be here mentioned, and for that cauſe I omit them here, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40544:179"/>the common Triall thereof in our Law is by Verdict of 12. men, who ſhall be ſworne upon the Booke to ſpeake the truth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their conſcience. And ſometimes the matter ſhall be tried by the Biſhop, and not by Verdict of 12. men; as generall Baſtardy alledged in any of the parties it ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Biſhop, and in a <hi>Quaere impedit</hi> if the iſſue be joyned upon the inſtitution it ſhall be tryed by the Biſhop, for the ſame is in a manner a ſpirituall thing. But induction ſhall be tryed by Jury, and alſo in a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> if iſſue be taken upon Plenary it ſhall be tryed by the Biſhop; but whether the Church be void or not void ſhall be tryed by the Jury. And if the Parties be at iſſue in a <hi>quare impedit</hi> upon the ability of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whether he were ſufficiently learned or not, it ſhall be tryed by the Biſhop during the life of the Clerke, but if the Clerke be dead it ſhall be tryed by Jury. And it is ſaid, That if Baſtardy or other the like thing be alledged upon a thing which is not but dillatory, it ſhall be remanded to the Biſhop to be tryed, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And a man in an Action of Debt brought againſt him upon a Contract may wage his Law, to ſweare upon a Booke that he oweth not the Plaintiffe the money which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, nor any penny thereof; and he ought to have with him 11. more to ſweare with him, that they beleeve in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he ſayeth truth, and ſo he ſhall be diſcharged; but if the Action be brought
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40544:179"/>upon any ſpecialty, or upon matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or upon a thing touching Land, &amp;c. he ſhall not help himſelfe in that manner, but ſhall put the ſame upon the tryall of the Jury, but he himſelfe ſhall not be admitted to ſweare, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And note, that an Oath ought to have three Companions, Truth, Juſtice, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if they be wanting it is no Oath but a Perjury; for if a man be forced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to ſweare, that for many yeares he quiely held ſuch Lands, &amp;c. it is Perjury, not in him who ſweareth, but in him who compelleth him to ſweare, <hi>Reum non facit niſt mens ſit rea.
